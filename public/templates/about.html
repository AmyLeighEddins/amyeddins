<h1 id="addTitle" class="labels"> About </h1>
<h4> Hey! I'm a software developer in Birmingham, Alabama. I graduated from Auburn University in 2014 with a degree in Software Engineering.
  While at Auburn I worked as a co-op, intern, and research assistant. If I'm not working, I'm either listening to music, playing video/board/tabletop games, or crafting.
