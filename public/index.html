      <h4> Hey! I'm a software developer currently working for Command Alkon in Birmingham, Alabama. I graduated from Auburn University in 2014 with a degree in Software Engineering.
        While at Auburn I worked as a co-op, intern, and research assistant. If I'm not working, I'm either listening to music, playing video/board/tabletop games, or crafting.
